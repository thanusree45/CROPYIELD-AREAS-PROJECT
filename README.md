# Crop Yield Analysis

This project explores the dynamics of crop yield using the `crop_yield.csv` dataset. The analysis uses Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and derive insights into the factors affecting agricultural productivity.

## Key Features:
- Analysis of crop yield trends over time
- State-specific yield variations
- Correlations between crop yield and environmental factors
- Visualizations of trends and patterns

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset:
The dataset can be found [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saincoder404/crop-yield-data-india].

## Instructions:
To view or run the analysis, clone this repository and open the `Crop_Yield_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
